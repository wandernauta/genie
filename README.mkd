# genie

*genie* is a simple Python script that, for a given C++ header file, comes up
with stubs for its implementation (.cpp) file. It's like a crude version of
Eclipse's Implement Methods refactoring option.

*genie* requires `ctags` to be installed. It's compatible with Python 2 and
Python 3.

## Editors

I use *genie* from inside vim. This is in my vimrc:

    command! Genie execute ":.! genie %"
